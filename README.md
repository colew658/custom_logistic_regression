# Project Overview
In this project, we created a custom implementation of one-versus-all logistic regression. We used object-oriented programming to allow users to specify multiple solvers (Newton's method, steepest descent, and stochastic gradient descent), objective functions (maximum likelihood and mean-squared error), regularization terms (L1, L2, and elastic net), and eta (learning rate) and C (regularization strength) values. We also created a custom grid search algorithm for hyperparameter tuning. We then applied this to a customer segmentation dataset, and achieved similar performance results to that of SciKit-Learn.
